** NOTE **: if any problem arise while running the project , "handtest" file can be run individually which contains the whole project                                                                                    #TOUCH VIRTUAL

PROJECT OBJECTIVE :-

The objective is to manage computers and other devices WITH non touch displays in a way to interact them through 
touch interfrence without the need of any special hardware devices.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :-

..TO DESIGN VISION BASED MOUSE WHICH DETECTS HAND GESTURES PATTERNS INSTEAD OF PHYSICAL MOUSE.
..BASICALLY WE USE DETECTION OF FINGER TIP WHICH ARE CAPTURED BY  WEBCAM.
..THE CAMERA IS POSITIONED SUCH THAT IT RECOGNIZESTHE MOTION OF FINGER TIPS AND PERFORMS THE OPERATIONS OF MOUSE. 

INTRODUCTION :-

AS COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO DEVOLOP,PEOPLE HAVE SMALLER ELECTRONIC DEVICES.
INCREASINGLY WE ARE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN COMPUTING INTERACTIONS(HCI), AND INPARTICULAR VISION-BASED GESTURE AND OBJECT RECOGNITION.
IN OUR PROJECT , WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH THAT USES A VIEDO DEVICE TO CONTROL THE MOUSE SYSYTEM(MOUSE TASKS).
WE EMPLOY SEVERAL IMAGES PROCESSING ALGORITHM TO IMPLEMENT THIS.

APPLICATION AND FUTURE WORK :-

Control of cursor and clicking action in various devices.
In the future, we plan to add more features such as enlarging and shrinking windows, closing window, etc..by using plam.

FLOW CHART :-

 Start--> Bounding box--> Image acquistion--> Hand detection--> coordinate extraction--> Event generation.

Advantages :-

.The main advantage of using hand gestures is to interact with computer as a non-contact human computer input modality.

.Reduce hardware cost by eliminating use of mouse.

.Convenient for users not comfortable with touchpad.

.The framework may be useful for controlling different types of games and other applications dependent on the controlled through user defined gestures.

Conclusion :-

We are developing a system to control the mouse cursor using a real-time camera.
This system is based on computer vision algorithms and can do all mouse tasks.
However, it is difficult to get stable results because of the variety of lighting and skin colors of human races.
This system could be useful in presentations and to reduce work space.
